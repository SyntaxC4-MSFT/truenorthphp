In this whirlwind tour of programming with collection pipelines, you\'ll learn how to use functional programming ideas to break down complex code and abstract hidden duplication behind expressive higher order functions.

Together we\'ll refactor ugly, complicated spaghetti into a series of simple, elegant transformations; free of loops, complex conditionals, and temporary variables.

Never write another loop again.'

What\'s the difference between a mock and a stub? Are my tests allowed to hit the database? How do I test this billing code that interacts with Stripe?

Together we\'ll TDD a fresh Laravel app from scratch, never writing a line of code without writing a test first. I\'ll show you how to get the ball rolling with your application\'s very first test, how to add new features with outside-in TDD, and how to design tests that make it easy to refactor with confidence.'
