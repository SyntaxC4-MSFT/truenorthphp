you store your data in an optimal way. This presentation make you grow up from
just starting with MongoDB, to a seasoned user, by teaching you how to design
your data schema according to your application\'s needs. This requires a
different mind set than designing for a relational database.

Besides schema design techniques, I will also cover how to pick indexes,
different types of indexes, and way to find out why queries are potentially not
as fast as they could be.'

geospatial data, such as roads, points of interests and more.

First we will be importing an OpenStreetMap dataset covering Toronto into
MongoDB. This is not trivial due to the amount of data.

After importing, we will look at which types of queries we can
run to find things. Either by predicates, or with geospatial queries.

And last we will have a look at how to display the data that we\'ve requested,
through a website using the Leaflet mapping library.'
