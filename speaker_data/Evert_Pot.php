Since WebDAV is based on HTTP, we can use PHP to create applications that directly
integrate with a users’ file system.

While WebDAV itself is pretty old-school, it actually allows for some interesting
applications, and integration is easier than you might think.

This talk walks you through the basics of WebDAV, and then we’ll you started
with sabre/dav. By the end of this talk you should be able to create a simple
virtual filesystem with PHP.'

that it was ever intended to be written and maintained by people.

Nearly every stylesheet I\'ve seen has been started with great intentions.
But in the end the ease of quickly adding another class
tends to outweigh the discipline required to keep things organized and logical.

If you recognize this problem, Sass may be of help.

In this talk we\'ll be discussing the various features of Sass, how you can
integrate it into your workflow, and what some of the best practices are.'
