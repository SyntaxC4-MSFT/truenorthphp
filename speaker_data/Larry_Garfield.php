Larry has been an active Drupal contributor and consultant for over a decade, and led the Drupal 8 Web Services initiative that helped transform Drupal into a modern PHP platform.

Larry is Director of Runtimes and Integrations at Platform.sh, a leading continuous deployment cloud hosting company. He is responsible for Platform's container-based products and developer advocacy, with an aim to make hosting major OSS projects with Platform.sh 'stupid easy'. He is also still a de facto Drupal developer evangelist within the PHP community, as well as the Drupal representative to the Framework Interoperability Group.

Larry holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from DePaul University.

Larry is a co-author of 'Drupal 7 Module Development' from Packt Publishing. He blogs at both http://platform.sh/ and http://www.garfieldtech.com/.",

Enter Drupal 8: Almost a complete rewrite under the hood, Drupal 8 is a modern, PHP 5.5-boasting, REST-capable, object-oriented powerhouse. Now leveraging 3rd party components from no less than 9 different projects, Drupal 8 aims to be the premiere Content Management Platform for PHP.

But how do you use all this new-fangled stuff? This session will provide a walkthrough of Drupal's key systems and APIs, intended to give developers a taste of what building with Drupal 8 will be like.

Prior familiarity with Drupal 7 is helpful but will not be assumed.",
