With the popularity of Javascript libraries like Node.js and Meteor, websockets are Hot Stuff™. But just because they’re popular with the Javascript crowd doesn’t mean PHP applications are left out in the cold.

        In this talk, we will discuss three different use cases for websockets as well as strategies for implementing websockets into your PHP application. We will look at the most popular websocket protocols and specifically an overview of the WAMP protocol (the protocol, not the stack - http://wamp-proto.org) and the PHP Ratchet library. At the end of this talk, you’ll have a better sense of what websockets are, how they work, and how to use them in your application.'
