As a custom CMS provider, we asked ourselves: could we somehow force communication officers, marketing gurus, bloggers and content editors to fall in line with our PHP coders and adhere to common version control principles? And if so, what would we gain? Would we find a stream of seamless pull requests, or a never-ending disaster of merge conflicts, blames, and end-user frustration? I will share how we saw a bit of both, describe challenges of managing content like code, and our approaches for translating Git-jargon to business users. But also, I hope to discuss the enormous gains that can be achieved when mapping DevOps processes onto the business world." ,
