In a past life, she was an AngularJS early adopter at an edtech research lab at Columbia University. She has a BFA in Communication Design from Carnegie Mellon University, and a Masters from the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU.

          "text" => "You've built an API to support your company's internal technical needs, and now you're thinking about opening it up either to the public or to a set of approved third-party partner developers. What's next? At NPR, we spent most of 2015 building a developer platform for our cloud-based listening app, NPR One, and the six key technical components that we've focused on are: authorization (using OAuth 2.0); documentation; permissioning; rate limiting; self-service console; and a versioning strategy. Come learn how we did it, including lessons learned, things that (often to our own amazement) worked out well, and a myriad of things that we wish we'd done differently, from an NPR developer. (And yes, we did it all in PHP!)

While not highly technical (there won't be much, if any, code on the screen), this is intended to be an intermediate-level talk; ideally, you'll have built an API, are totally comfortable talking about your tech stack, and have built or used an OAuth client in the past, so you're familiar with the general principles of the OAuth 2.0 protocol."
