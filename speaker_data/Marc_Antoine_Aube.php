Over the years, I've used a wide variety of tools and languages to help businesses solve complex problems and create value for their customers. I have a strong focus on testable and maintainable code, and love talking about software patterns, architecture and best practices.

When not coding, you can probably find me on a trail somewhere remote, reading a book in my hammock.",

Learn what mutation testing is, and how Humbug can help you give your test suite a run for its money. Humbug is a tool that injects defects and regressions in your code and then checks if your tests noticed."
