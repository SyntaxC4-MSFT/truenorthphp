                            Microsoft Azure is open, flexible and a scalable platform which is a great choice for app creation. Azure supports virtual machines on several Linux flavors such as CentOS, Ubuntu, Suse. Not only does it support open platforms but also open development tools. Support for the various development tools is pretty exhaustive. For example, look into what we have in store for Azure and PHP at the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/php/" target="_blank">PHP Development Centre</a>, a rich resource for tutorials and documentation, which will enable you to get started with development on the cloud. Also look into the support for <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6eb51f05-ef01-4513-ac83-4c5f50c95fb5" target="_blank">PHP tools for Visual Studio</a>, which provides a well known editor for PHP, HTML/JAVA/CSS support and most importantly integration with Azure itself.<br>

                            <a href="http://www.delvia.com">Delvia</a> started when several senior developers, linux system administrators and DevOps engineers got to talking about our observations about the software development industry. We agreed that companies universally have issues hiring and keeping the right people in the area of DevOps. We also agreed that developers, operations peoplre and devops engineers employed by large companies can have a tendency to not keep their skills up to date and thus have a difficult time adapting to a rapidly changing development landscape.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        As a result of this conversation we concluded that we should join together. Using our vast experience we could provide a better alternative and offer it to businesses of all sizes. We made a resolution to acquire the best talent, use the best tools and provide the necessary training to stay on top of the DevOps industry.
